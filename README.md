# 🚀 CodeCollab

CodeCollab is a modern, real-time collaborative coding platform that makes coding together effortless.
Designed for **pair programming**, **remote teaching**, **technical interviews**, and **team projects**, all in one seamless experience.


## ✨ Highlights

### Real-Time Collaboration
Edit code together live every keystroke syncs instantly.
A smart **line-locking system** prevents code collisions by locking the line while someone types (auto-unlocks after few seconds).

### Built-in Chat
Discuss logic, share snippets, and coordinate in real time right beside your code.

### VS Code-like File Management
Create folders, add or rename files, and organize your workspace intuitively just like VS Code.

### Access Control
- **Public Projects**: Anyone with a link can view
- **Private Projects**: Only invited collaborators can access
- **Roles**: Owner, Collaborator, Viewer

### Presence Tracking
Know who's online, what they're editing, and collaborate efficiently.

### Seamless UI
Crafted with **Next.js** + **shadcn/ui** + **Tailwind**, optimized for all devices i.e mobile, tablet, and desktop.
